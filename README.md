# Flasket: Flask(tick)et

This is a Ticket service for your [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) application.


---
## Blueprint

We developed this as a [Blueprint](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/blueprints/) branch: you only need to copy our `ticket` folder in you application and setup a couple of `import` and you will have your ticketing system on!

[Blueprint](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/blueprints/) is integrated in [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and allows you to logically organize your different application services (e.g. tickets, api, etc.) in different folders, making development (and your life) extremely easier! :sunglasses:

It also has the advantage of creating a URL with the service name before any of the service's endpoints! Ex. `localhost/<service>/<endpoint>`
